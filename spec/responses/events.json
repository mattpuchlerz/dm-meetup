I was happy to find that Chirb is already going strong. I think, however, that there is a room to do more.\r\n\r\nI would like this meetup to focus on working together, sharing knowledge, and working on projects. How does one write good code? How does one get a project going and keep it healthy?\r\n\r\nI want to build a network of people who want to get things done - to motivate and be motivated in turn by talking and above all doing work with others.\r\n\r\nCome out to the first meeting - let's see what we can do.\r\n\r\nWe will meet at: Forest Park Library, November 5 (Sunday), 3 pm.

It also includes a second form builder that provides edit in place functionality using jquery, to switch from displaying labels to form elements. Additionally, the tabular form builder can make a nested call to the edit in place builder, providing combined functionality.","venue_address2":"","venue_city":"","venue_address3":"","name":"ChicagoRuby.org: Legacy Migrations & Forms","venue_id":"","rsvp_closed":"0","venue_state":"","lat":"41.880001068115234","group_name":"ChicagoRuby","rsvp_limit":"30","lon":"-87.63999938964844","no_rsvpcount":"8","photo_url":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/6\/6\/e\/global_9569742.jpeg","group_photo_url":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/6\/6\/e\/global_9569742.jpeg","group_id":"288361","questions":[],"rsvp_cutoff":"None","organizer_name":"Ray Hightower","feecurrency":"USD","attendee_count":"21","venue_phone":"","venue_lon":"","fee":"0.0","venue_map":"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/staticmap?center=41.880001068115234,-87.63999938964844&zoom=14&size=512x512&maptype=mobile&markers=41.880001068115234,-87.63999938964844,blues&key=ABQIAAAAiB79SpLrOxrYbOzqaYGrvhQrNhSbWhQbZXKDt0w9V4y2n6CzahTrHTbQjuSGhL4xdTPFH0lRNNe4-A&sensor=false","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ChicagoRuby\/calendar\/8923151\/","venue_lat":""},{"rsvpcount":"27","venue_name":"","maybe_rsvpcount":"0","organizer_id":"3576901","allow_maybe_rsvp":"0","myrsvp":"yes","id":"8923173","time":"Sat Apr 18 15:00:00 CDT 2009","venue_zip":"","feedesc":"","ismeetup":"1","venue_address1":"","updated":"Sat May 16 16:49:21 EDT 2009","description":"Practice makes perfect.

There have been lots of talks about how you should test more, but Jake is going to dare to talk about when you should test less. Too much testing can lead to backlash, gridlock, morale problems, and poor velocity. Of course lack of testing can lead to bad design, gridlock, morale problems, and poor velocity.
